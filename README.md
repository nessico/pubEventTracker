# MERN Stack

Users can asynchronously CRUD events, CSV, XLS, and XLSX files into the database 

1)	Install the uploaded files
2)	Create 2 command terminals  (one for server and one for client)
3)	For the server terminal:	
  a)	cd to server folder
  b)	run the command: node index.js (server should be running on port 3000)
4)	For the client terminal:
  a)	cd to client folder
  b)	run the command: npm start
c)	Enter: Y , when the command line asks if you wish to run on another port instead   (server should be using port 3000, the set port for client is 3001 for this demonstration)
5)	Enter: http://localhost:3001/
